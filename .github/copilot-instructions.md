# Copilot instructions for m25-javascript-02

This file gives concise, actionable guidance for AI coding agents (Copilot, assistants) working in this repository. Keep edits minimal and preserve the human-friendly learning examples in each `AulaNN` folder.

Quick facts
- Project type: training/teaching repository with multiple lessons under `Aula01..Aula07` and an `Atividade` folder. Mostly static HTML/CSS/JS examples.
- Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (plain frontend). No build system present.
- Primary files to inspect when implementing or modifying examples: `Aula07/trabalho_v1.html`, `Aula07/main.js`, `Aula04/index.html`, and `Aula07/trabalho_v1.css` (if present).

What we're optimizing for
- Preserve and clarify student-facing examples (don't remove example files or replace with complex frameworks).
- Keep edits simple, browser-compatible, and easy to run locally (double-click HTML or host with a simple static server).

Repository structure (important files)
- `Aula07/` — advanced lesson files and final `trabalho_v1.html` (student project). This is the most active folder.
- `Aula06/`, `Aula05/`, `Aula04/` — earlier lesson examples used as references for style and conventions.
- `Atividade/Apresentacao.html` — presentation used in the course; avoid breaking links or assets referenced by it.
- `Aula03/README.md` — contains notes about class setup; useful context for comments or docs.

Coding conventions & patterns to follow
- Keep code vanilla: plain DOM APIs, inline or small external scripts. Avoid adding frameworks (React/Vue) unless the task explicitly needs it.
- Styles: lightweight CSS files next to HTML (e.g., `Aula06/exemplo02.css`). Prefer adding new CSS files rather than changing global styles in older lessons.
- File naming: lesson files use `exemploNN.html`, `trabalho_vN.html`, `main.js`. Use consistent naming when adding new examples.

Examples of common patterns
- Simple script inclusion: <script src="main.js"></script> in the same folder as the HTML file (no bundler).
- Local testing: open the HTML file in a browser or run a static server (`python -m http.server` or `npx serve`) when using fetch or modules.

Workflows & commands
- No build or test system. To preview changes locally:
  - Windows PowerShell: python -m http.server 8000; then open http://localhost:8000/Aula07/trabalho_v1.html
  - Or use any static-file server of choice.

When editing student files
- Make minimal, well-commented changes. Add comments explaining why changes were made, especially in `trabalho_v1.html` and `main.js`.
- Preserve backup files like `bruno01_BACKUP_328.html` and `bruno01_BASE_328.html`.

Integration points & external dependencies
- Expect no external build-time dependencies. If adding third-party libs, prefer CDN links and add a short comment explaining the choice.

Edge cases & safety
- Avoid network calls to private APIs. If a feature needs an API, add a stub with clear instructions for replacement and sample response data.

If merging with an existing `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Preserve any human-written rationale and lesson notes. Merge only by adding or updating bullet points above; don't remove historical lesson files.

Useful files to open first when working here
- `Aula07/trabalho_v1.html` — primary student project
- `Aula07/main.js` — supporting JS for Aula07 examples
- `Aula04/index.html` and `Aula06/exemplo02.html` — earlier examples to copy patterns from

Feedback and iteration
- If anything in these instructions is unclear or missing (e.g., local testing nuances, file that drives index), leave a short TODO comment here or open an issue.
